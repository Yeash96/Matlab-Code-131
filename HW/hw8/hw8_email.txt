Hello,

I noticed that on the homework the 5 point centered difference formula is divided by '2*h'. In the textbook it was divided by '12*h'. The code I have written also seems to refelct this since I get a gragh that seems to be incorrect when using '2*h' but correct when using '12*h'.

your student,
